=== FMT_MOF.1/AutoUpdate Management of Security Functions Behaviour

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

*Test 1:* The evaluator shall try to enable and disable automatic checking for updates or automatic updates (whichever is supported by the TOE) without prior authentication as Security Administrator (by authenticating as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication). The attempt to enable/disable automatic checking for updates should fail. According to the implementation no other users than the Security Administrator might be defined and without any user authentication the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt to enable/disable automatic checking for updates can be executed. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.

*Test 2:* The evaluator shall try to enable and disable automatic checking for updates or automatic updates (whichever is supported by the TOE) with prior authentication as Security Administrator. The attempt to enable/disable automatic checking for updates should be successful. +
