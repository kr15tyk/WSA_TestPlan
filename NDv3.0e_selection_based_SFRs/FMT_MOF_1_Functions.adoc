=== FMT_MOF.1/Functions Management of Security Functions Behaviour

*If ‘transmission of audit data to external IT entity’ is selected from the second selection together with 'modify the behaviour of' in the first selection*
[arabic, start=546]

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

*Test 1:* The evaluator shall try to modify all security related parameters for configuration of the transmission protocol for transmission of audit data to an external IT entity without prior authentication as Security Administrator (by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all). Attempts to modify parameters without prior authentication should fail. According to the implementation no other users than the Security Administrator might be defined and without any user authentication the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt to modify the security related parameters can be executed. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.

*Test 2:* The evaluator shall try to modify all security related parameters for configuration of the transmission protocol for transmission of audit data to an external IT entity with prior authentication as Security Administrator. The effects of the modifications should be confirmed.

The evaluator does not have to test all possible values of the security related parameters for configuration of the transmission protocol for transmission of audit data to an external IT entity but at least one allowed value per parameter.

*If 'handling of audit data' is selected from the second selection together with 'modify the behaviour of' in the first selection*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

*Test 1:* The evaluator shall try to modify all security related parameters for configuration of the handling of audit data without prior authentication as Security Administrator (by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all). Attempts to modify parameters without prior authentication should fail. According to the implementation no other users than the Security Administrator might be defined and without any user authentication the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt can be executed. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator. The term ‘handling of audit data’ refers to the different options for selection and assignments in SFRs FAU_STG_EXT.1.4, FAU_STG_EXT.1.5 and FAU_STG_EXT.2.

*Test 2:* The evaluator shall try to modify all security related parameters for configuration of the handling of audit data with prior authentication as Security Administrator. The effects of the modifications should be confirmed. The term ‘handling of audit data’ refers to the different options for selection and assignments in SFRs FAU_STG_EXT.1.4, FAU_STG_EXT.1.5 and FAU_STG_EXT.2.

The evaluator does not necessarily have to test all possible values of the security related parameters for configuration of the handling of audit data but at least one allowed value per parameter.

*If 'audit functionality when Local Audit Storage Space is full' is selected from the second selection together with 'modify the behaviour of' in the first selection*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

*Test 1:* The evaluator shall try to modify the behaviour when Local Audit Storage Space is full without prior authentication as Security Administrator (by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all). This attempt should fail. According to the implementation no other users than the Security Administrator might be defined and without any user authentication the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt can be executed. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.

*Test 2:* The evaluator shall try to modify the behaviour when Local Audit Storage Space is full with prior authentication as Security Administrator. This attempt should be successful. The effect of the change shall be verified.

The evaluator does not necessarily have to test all possible values for the behaviour when Local Audit Storage Space is full but at least one change between allowed values for the behaviour.

*If in the first selection 'determine the behaviour of' has been chosen together with for any of the options in the second selection*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

*Test 1:* The evaluator shall try to determine the behaviour of all options chosen from the second selection without prior authentication as Security Administrator (by authentication as a user with no administrator privileges or without user authentication at all). This can be done in one test or in separate tests. The attempt(s) to determine the behaviour of the selected functions without administrator authentication shall fail. According to the implementation no other users than the Security Administrator might be defined and without any user authentication the user might not be able to get to the point where the attempt can be executed. In that case it shall be demonstrated that access control mechanisms prevent execution up to the step that can be reached without authentication as Security Administrator.

*Test 2:* The evaluator shall try to determine the behaviour of all options chosen from the second selection with prior authentication as Security Administrator. This can be done in one test or in separate tests. The attempt(s) to determine the behaviour of the selected functions with Security Administrator authentication shall be successful. +
