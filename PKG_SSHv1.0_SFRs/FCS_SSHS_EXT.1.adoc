=== FCS_SSHS_EXT.1 SSH Protocol - Server

*FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.1*

The evaluator shall repeat Test 1 and Test 2 from FCS_SSH_EXT.1.4 for each of the authentication mechanisms supported by the TOE.

Next the evaluator shall configure the remote peer to only allow an authentication mechanism that is not included in the ST selection. The evaluator shall attempt to connect to the TOE and observe that the attempt fails.

*FCS_SSH_EXT.1.4*

The evaluator shall perform the following tests:

If the TOE can be both a client and a server, these tests must be performed for both roles.

*Test 1:* The evaluator must ensure that only claimed algorithms and cryptographic primitives are used to establish an SSH connection. To verify this, the evaluator shall establish an SSH connection with a remote endpoint. The evaluator shall capture the traffic exchanged between the TOE and the remote endpoint during protocol negotiation (e.g. using a packet capture tool or information provided by the endpoint, respectively). The evaluator shall verify from the captured traffic that the TOE offers only the algorithms defined in the ST for the TOE for SSH connections. The evaluator shall perform one successful negotiation of an SSH connection and verify that the negotiated algorithms were included in the advertised set. If the evaluator detects that not all algorithms defined in the ST for SSH are advertised by the TOE or the TOE advertises additional algorithms not defined in the ST for SSH, the test shall be regarded as failed.

The data collected from the connection above shall be used for verification of the advertised hashing and shared secret establishment algorithms in FCS_SSH_EXT.1.5 and FCS_SSH_EXT.1.6 respectively.

*Test 2:* For the connection established in Test 1, the evaluator shall terminate the connection and observe that the TOE terminates the connection. +
